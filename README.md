#### This repo is only implementing Bilinear CNN model( Cannot provide dataset as I have trained on Private Data).

#### Can be reused for any fine grained image classification prblems.

##### Divided into 2 files.

>Bilinear from output of 2 parallel VGG16 ouputs taken from layer 17 from each.

>Bilinear CNN from 2 custom CNN's of same sized output.
